### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Allyson, I believe we have to work for an open web, with FOSS. Among several things, I like design, programming and games. I am one of the founders of [@HasteDesign](https://github.com/HasteDesign), which entered in hiatus Aug/22, and currently I'm a developer at [@NextPress](https://github.com/next-press). I contribute, whenever possible, to the WordPress community in SÃ£o Paulo, although Iâ€™m a bit away at the moment.
